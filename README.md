my-little-miss-books
====================

Books my daughter wrote inspired by the [Little Miss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Men#.22Little_Miss.22_series) books, translated into HTML flip books.

## Credits

As with most of my work I stand on the shoulders of giants that came before me:

* [turn.js](https://github.com/blasten/turn.js) powers the fantastic browser-and-mobile-friendly flip effect
* [Little Miss Cursive font](http://www.fontspace.com/kiddiefonts/little-miss-cursive) emulates the font that is usually on the inside cover of the Little Miss books
* [Daisy Script font](http://www.1001fonts.com/daisy-script-font.html) emulates the hand written signature of the author of the Little Miss books

## TODO

I wish there was a simple drag-n-swipe environment to make these sort of books instead of hand-coding the HTML and having to use a drawing tool. Hey, that sound like a tablet app idea!
